# RainFall-Prediction
A rainfall prediction system with an exploratory data analysis and web application.

Over the most recent quite a few years, weather conditions have become a significant subject of study. The specialist had tried to construct a straight connection between the information climate information and the connected objective information much of the time. Nonetheless, after the revelation of nonlinearity in climate information, considera-tion has changed to nonlinear climate information forecast. Even though there is an abundance of writing on nonlinear insights for weather conditions determining, most of them need the nonlinear model to be depicted preceding assessment. Be that as it may, because meteorological information is nonlinear and has an exceptionally unpredictable pattern, Artificial Intelligence has demonstrated to be a more compelling device for uncovering underlying connections between the different parts.
