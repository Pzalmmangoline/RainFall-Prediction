          <h2>Save Rain<br></h2>
          <p>"Rainfall information in the past helps farmers better manage their crops, leading to economic growth in the country. 
            Prediction of precipitation is beneficial to prevent flooding that saves people's lives and property. 
            Fluctuation in the timing of precipitation and its amount makes forecasting of rainfall a problem for meteorological scientists. 
            To overcome these problems, a machine learning technology is used which is predictive analysis that is a branch of data mining which predicts the future probabilities and trends.
            I used the CATBOOST model in deployment of this Web Application</p>

      <h2>Modern Rain Prediction</h2>
      <p class="about-content" style="text-align: center;">Meteorologists use a process called numerical weather prediction to create forecasts by inputting current conditions — which they call the “nowcast” — into computer models. 
        The more current and accurate information available to these models, the better the forecast will be. 
        Ground radar, weather balloons, aircraft, satellites, ocean buoys and more can provide three-dimensional observations that a model can use. 
        This allows meteorologists to simulate what the atmosphere is currently doing and predict what will happen in the next few days or, for some models, hours.
        This proposed method uses Australian meteorological dataset to predict the rain fall.
        Usually machine learning algorithms are classified into two major categories i.e. unsupervised learning and supervised learning. 
        All of the clustering algorithms come under the supervised machine learning. 
        Even though many models have developed, it is necessary for doing research using machine learning algorithms to get accurate predictions. 
        The error free prediction provides better planning in the agriculture and other industries, Henceforth we have used the CatBoost model for faster and accurate prediction
